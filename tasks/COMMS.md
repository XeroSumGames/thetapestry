# COMMS.md - open questions, test plans, decisions in flight

Single source of truth for "what's open, what's answered" across all four
sessions. Route decisions through this file instead of asking Xero (or
each other) in scattered chat messages the others never see.

**Owned by the dedicated Comms channel** (`tasks/lane-protocol.md`,
"Comms channel" section, added 2026-08-02) - Comms is responsible for
keeping this current, verifying an OPEN item is actually
reachable/testable before packaging it as a test plan, and resolving
items into ANSWERED. Any session can still add an OPEN item directly -
don't wait for Comms to notice something needs asking - Comms picks it
up from there.

**This is not a duplicate of `tasks/active-lanes.md`** (that's "who's
touching what file right now") or `tasks/decisions.md` (that's the
append-only architectural-decision log, permanent record). This file is
for things actively waiting on an answer - a question for Xero, a test
plan that needs running before a fix can be called done, a cross-lane
call that needs the hub's ruling. Once resolved, the item moves to
ANSWERED here; if it was ALSO an architectural decision worth permanently
remembering, it gets its own entry in `decisions.md` too.

*(dated log, newest first - move an item here the moment it's resolved,
don't let this file's OPEN section accumulate stale asks)*

- **[2026-08-02] portrait-bank read-side confidentiality - Xero decided option (a):** flip the bucket private, rework every `getPublicUrl()` consumer to signed URLs. Routed to Puffer Fish to schedule/implement.
- **[2026-08-02] Account-deletion anonymize mismatch - Xero decided: build it for real.** Nullable `author_user_id` + "Anonymous" UI fallback across `forum_threads`/`war_stories`/`lfg_posts`/`whispers`, matching the existing `modules` pattern. Routed to Puffer Fish (schema) to coordinate with Hunt & Peck (UI half).
